|       Novelty       | The original wind power series is first decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions by complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition, and then a Bernstein polynomial forecasting model with mixture of Gaussians is constructed. Finally, a population- based multi-objective state transition algorithm with parallel search mechanism is developed to optimize the parameters of the hybrid model. |
